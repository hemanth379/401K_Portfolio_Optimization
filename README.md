# 401K Portfolio Optimization Model - README

## Project Overview

This project is part of the BAN 630 course at California State University East Bay, where we developed a model to optimize 401K investments for the Principal Financial Group. The objective was to maximize returns over a 10-year period while adhering to predefined risk parameters. 

### Key Features:
- **Optimization Goal:** Maximize 10-year return within specified risk constraints.
- **Data Analyzed:** Historical performance of 21 investment funds.
- **Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel and Solver add-in.

### Company Background:
Principal Financial Group is a global financial investment management and insurance company headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa. They offer a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement solutions, investment management, and insurance.

### Problem Statement:
The main problem is determining which mutual funds to select and the percentage of total investment to allocate to each fund to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

### Solution Approach:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered historical performance data of 21 funds offered by Principal.
2. **Optimization Model:** Used Excel Solver to create a model that maximizes the Average Annual Total Return over 10 years, considering risk profiles.
3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conducted sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of constraints on the model.

### Constraints:
- Achieve specific return targets (3% in 1 year, 6% in 3 years, 8% in 5 years, 10% in 10 years).
- Maintain average risk below specified thresholds.
- Ensure total investment distribution equals 100%.

## Model Results
- **Optimal Allocation:** Allocated 24.26% to LargeCap S&P 500 Index Separate Account and 75.74% to LargeCap Growth I Separate Account, achieving a 12.34% return over 10 years.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identified that the maximum return is sensitive to variations in average risk levels, particularly between risk levels 3 and 4.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated a systematic approach to optimizing a 401K portfolio by balancing return and risk. The model provides valuable insights for investors seeking to optimize their retirement portfolios.
